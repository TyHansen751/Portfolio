I will earn my BS degree in Statistics and Data Analytics from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln in May 2027. My objective upon graduation is to become a successful sports analytics professional in professional basketball.\nDuring my research into NBA analytics opportunities, I learned about the Pacers’ commitment to using data driven insights for player development and game strategy. Your organization’s approach to combining traditional basketball knowledge with advanced analytics impressed me. I am very interested in becoming apart of the analytics team contributing to the Pacers’ competitive success.\nAs my enclosed resume explains, I have completed courses related to sports analytics applications, including Statistical Learning, Data Visualization, and Regression Analysis. I am also proficient in several analytical tools such as R and Python for data processing and visualization. In addition, my experience as a Business Analyst Intern at Sandhills Global has demonstrated my ability to work with teams and to apply my technical knowledge to solve practical business problems.\nI am looking forward to discussing my qualifications with you. Please feel free to contact me either at (402) 785-8122 or at thansen36@huskers.unl.edu. Meanwhile, I appreciate your help and attention.\nSincerely,\nTyler Hansen\nEnclosure"
