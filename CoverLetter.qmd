Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the Basketball Analytics Intern position with the Indiana Pacers for Summer 2026. I will earn my BS degree in Statistics and Data Analytics from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln in May 2027. My objective upon graduation is to become a successful sports analytics professional in professional basketball.

During my research into NBA analytics opportunities, I learned about the Pacers' commitment to using data driven insights for player development and game strategy. Your organization's approach to combining traditional basketball knowledge with advanced analytics impressed me. I am very interested in becoming apart of the analytics team contributing to the Pacers' competitive success.

As my enclosed resume explains, I have completed courses related to sports analytics applications, including Statistical Learning, Data Visualization, and Regression Analysis. I am also proficient in several analytical tools such as R and Python for data processing and visualization. In addition, my experience as a Business Analyst Intern at Sandhills Global has demonstrated my ability to work with teams and to apply my technical knowledge to solve practical business problems.

I am looking forward to discussing my qualifications with you. Please feel free to contact me either at (402) 785-8122 or at thansen36\@huskers.unl.edu. Meanwhile, I appreciate your help and attention.

Sincerely,

Tyler Hansen
